# Severity-prediction-of-car-accidents

Road accidents cost the United States billions of dollars yearly in economic and societal damage. Furthermore, a small number of large incidents account for a significant share of the losses. However, preventing traffic accidents, especially significant ones, is never easy. The proactive technique, which focuses on preventing potentially dangerous road conditions from occurring first, is one of the two main approaches to dealing with traffic safety concerns. The effectiveness of this method hinges on the ability to foresee accidents and their severity.

# a) The reasoning for the choice of Project:
The first goal is to find out the factors that affect the severity. The second goal is to create a model that can reliably forecast the severity of an accident. To be more explicit, this model is expected to predict the chance of a severe accident in a particular accident without any comprehensive information about the accident, such as driver qualities or vehicle type. For example, the catastrophe might have occurred recently, and details are still unavailable, or it could be one anticipated by other models. As a result, this model may predict serious accidents in real-time using the advanced traffic accident prediction system built by the inventors of the same data set utilized in this study.

The data has a wide range of applications; it can predict patterns in accidents, study accident locations and direct them to hospital locations. It can be used to make important policy decisions to reduce the number of accident severity. This data can also compare accidents caused by human driving patterns and accidents caused by self-driving cars.
